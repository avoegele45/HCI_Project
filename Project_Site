                <h2>Problem and Solution Overview</h2>
                <p>In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle while juggling personal and professional responsibilities can be challenging. Many individuals struggle to consistently track their physical activity, follow fitness plans, and achieve their health goals due to the inconvenience and intrusiveness of current fitness tracking solutions. To address this problem, we propose FitVision - a revolutionary smart contact lens that seamlessly integrates advanced fitness tracking capabilities into users' daily lives. By providing unobtrusive, real-time monitoring of key health metrics and offering personalized guidance and motivation, FitVision empowers users of all fitness levels to take control of their well-being and achieve their goals without compromising their lifestyle or comfort.</p>
        
                <h2>Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants</h2>
                <p>The design research was conducted by interview. We opted against a survey because we didn’t have enough people to include. Also, surveys offer general answers to questions for the most part, and we wanted specificity and detail. So, we interviewed several classmates, as well as relatives, and tried to vary their athletic abilities as much as possible. Each of the interviewees was asked relatively open-ended questions in a relaxed environment. Some interviews were conducted in the classroom, others at home. This approach helped interviewees feel comfortable, allowing them to express their true feelings about health and fitness.</p>
        
                <h2>Design Research Results and Themes</h2>
                <p>From our interviews, we were able to define a few distinct criteria. For the highly active people and the athletes, the most important aspect of health and fitness products was performance enhancement, including goals like getting stronger or decreasing run time. We also noted a need for products that prevent injuries or aid quicker recovery. Less active individuals highlighted the importance of ease of use and compatibility with daily life, indicating that while they are less consistent in their exercise routines, they value simplicity and minimal interference with their lifestyles.</p>
        
                <h2>Task Analysis</h2>
                <p>Detailed task analysis explored various aspects of user interaction with FitVision, from initial use to routine integration. Key questions included who would use the design, the tasks they perform, desired tasks, and how they learn these tasks. The analysis aimed to ensure that FitVision caters to a broad spectrum of users, from fitness enthusiasts to those new to regular physical activity.</p>

                <h2>Problem and Solution Overview</h2>
                <p>Many people struggle to maintain an active lifestyle and track their fitness goals effectively. Existing wearable fitness trackers can be inconvenient and lack seamless integration with everyday activities. Our solution is FitVision - augmented reality contact lenses that unobtrusively display real-time fitness data and workout guidance in the user's field of view. The lenses connect to a smartphone app that allows customizing the augmented reality display and setting/tracking fitness goals.</p>

                <p>The initial FitVision paper prototype consisted of a series of paper cutouts representing the augmented reality view through the contact lenses and the separate smartphone app interface. The prototype illustrated how users would interact with the two core tasks of recording daily physical activity and tracking fitness plans/health goals.</p>

                <p>User testing revealed several areas for improvement in terms of setup flow, interactive cues, error prevention, and customization, indicating the need for further refinement.</p>
                
                <h2>Testing Process</h2>
                <p>Our testing started off with us explaining our product. We let each participant know that the item we were manufacturing was a pair of contact lenses that could be used as not only vision helper, but also as a form of augmented reality where a HUD can be displayed in the user’s vision to their liking. The display aspect of our contact lenses can be customized by</p>
